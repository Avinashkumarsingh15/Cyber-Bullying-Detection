# Cyber-Bullying-Detection


In this project we aim to build a system in which we can extract the comments from any post on facebook and detect the cyber bullying by doing sentiment analysis. We’ll be segregating the comments as positive, negative, abusive, neutral, facts, etc. By having an understanding that facts on someone’s religion or the place the person live may be abusive or insulting we have introduced the category of facts. The heart of this model will be the mapping the comments of the user with reactions given by same user. This can be explained by an example, suppose a person posts a photo and some of his/her friend posts an abusive comments but along with a ‘love’ react on the post then that particular comment will not be considered as abusive or insulting because the friend have posted the comment with good intention. This model will also be compatible of translating the given text in any language into English and then doing the Sentiment Analysis.
We’ll also make an interactive visualization of the sentiment analysis and the reaction mapping done by the model so that any naïve user may understand the exact statistics.
