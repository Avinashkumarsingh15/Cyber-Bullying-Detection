# Cyber-Bullying-Detection


Cyberbullying includes sending, posting, or sharing negative, harmful, false, or mean content
about someone else over digital devices like cell phones, computers, and tablets through
SMS, text, and apps, or online in social media, forums, or gaming where people can view,
participate in, or share content. In this project we aim to build a system which can be proved
as a perfect cyber bullying detection system. For addressing this major issue we will apply
the knowledge of Natural Language Processing to develop a system that can understand
the sentiment behind a given text. The system will be trained using the Na√Øve Bayes Analyzer
and Pattern Analyzer on a predefined labelled dataset. Thereafter, the performance of the
system trained using each of these classifiers will be tested and compared on actual
comments posted on social media platforms.
