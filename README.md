# Cyber-Bullying-Detection


In this project we have built a system in which we can extract the comments from any post on facebook and detect the cyber bullying by doing sentiment analysis. This system will segregrate the comments as positive, negative, abusive, neutral, facts, etc. The heart of this model is that we have mapped the comments of the user with reactions given by same user to make the model more precise. <br/>
This can be explained by an example, suppose a person posts a photo and some of his/her friend posts an abusive comments but along with a ‘love’ react on the post then that particular comment will not be considered as abusive or insulting because the friend have posted the comment with good intention. <br/>
Furthermore, this model is also compatible of translating the given text in any language into English and then doing the Sentiment Analysis.<br/>
Then we have visualized the results in an interactive manner such that even a naive user can understand the exact statistics.
